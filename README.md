# Software Description
The software is a basic Hello World application using C# and printing to the Console.

# Purpose of creating this software
The purpose is to practice basic application creation skills using the famous Hello World model, typically used to create the first solutions in a platform and/or programming language. It allows other developers to see and learn the basic structure of a Hello World solution in C#.

# Development Environment

The development environment includes:
a) Visual Studio Code.

#Programming Language

C# (C Sharp) is a modern, object-oriented, and statically-typed programming language created by Microsoft as the primary language for the versatile .NET framework. Designed for reliability and performance, it combines C++ syntax with the safety features of Java. C# is cross-platform and widely used for developing powerful web backends/APIs, desktop applications, and video games (especially with the Unity engine), offering a balance between developer productivity and enterprise-level system control.

# CSE310---Hello-World-Module

# Overview

I intend to develop a Hello World application as a first step and introduction to the knowledge of interesting technologies, and at this first moment the construction of a simple application to print the Hello World message on the console.

# Software Description
The software is a basic Hello World application using C# and printing to the Console.

# Purpose of creating this software
The purpose is to practice basic application creation skills using the famous Hello World model, typically used to create the first solutions in a platform and/or programming language. It allows other developers to see and learn the basic structure of a Hello World solution in C#.
